# CI/CD Workflow for AI-Generated Code

This document outlines the continuous integration and delivery process specifically designed for safely integrating AI-generated code into production environments.

## Branch Naming Convention

- `ai-gen/feature-name` - For AI-generated code
- `ai-review/feature-name` - For reviewed AI code ready for testing
- `ai-prod/feature-name` - For production-ready AI code

## Workflow Stages

### 1. AI Development Stage

```
Developer creates branch → AI generates code → Initial automated checks
```

- Branch is created following `ai-gen/*` pattern
- Clear specifications provided to AI assistant
- AI generates code in isolated scope
- Initial linting and security scans run automatically
- Failing checks notify developer for immediate attention

### 2. Human Review Stage

```
Developer reviews code → Refinement cycle → Approval → Promotion
```

- Human developer reviews code structure, logic, and security implications
- Refinement cycle: AI improves code based on developer feedback
- Code follows established patterns from corresponding README guidelines
- When satisfied, developer approves and promotes to `ai-review/*` branch

### 3. Verification Stage

```
Comprehensive testing → Security assessment → Integration validation
```

- Full test suite execution (unit, integration, e2e)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Integration validation with existing systems
- Performance benchmarks compared to baselines

### 4. Production Readiness Stage

```
Approval workflow → Production promotion → Monitoring setup
```

- Senior developer approval required
- Documentation generation and review
- Branch promotion to `ai-prod/*`
- Merge to main branch via pull request
- Deployment with feature flags when possible
- Enhanced monitoring for AI-generated components

## Automated Checks

| Check Type | AI-Gen | AI-Review | AI-Prod |
|------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Linting | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Unit Tests | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Integration Tests | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| E2E Tests | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Security Scan | Basic | Advanced | Advanced |
| Performance | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Documentation | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Security Guardrails

- API access and secrets management strictly controlled
- Principle of least privilege enforced for AI-generated components
- Network isolation patterns preferred
- Input validation required at all boundaries
- Sanitization of untrusted data required
- Output encoding for appropriate contexts

## Handling Failures

1. If failures occur in AI-generated code:
   - Revert to previous stable version
   - Document failure mode for AI learning
   - Implement specific tests to prevent regression

2. AI assistant notification process:
   - Clear feedback on failure modes
   - Context for improvement in next iteration
   - Pattern examples for correct implementation

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of AI success/failure patterns
- Documentation updates based on common issues
- Feedback loop to improve AI prompting strategies
- Training of team members on effective AI collaboration
