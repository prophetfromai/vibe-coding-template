# AI/Human Collaboration Workflows

This directory documents the workflows and processes for AI/human collaboration in this repository.

## Available Workflows

1. **[Branch Automation](branch-automation.md)** - Standard three-stage workflow for AI-generated code
2. **[AI Safe Pipeline](ai-safe-pipeline.md)** - Iterative validation pipeline for safe AI code generation

## Workflow Comparison

| Feature | Branch Automation | AI Safe Pipeline |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Focus** | Simple promotion workflow | Comprehensive validation |
| **Iterations** | Single-pass | Multiple with progressive improvement |
| **Validation** | Manual human review | Automated + optional human review |
| **Branch Structure** | Three stages (gen, review, prod) | Multiple iterations with validation |
| **Best For** | Simple features, experienced teams | Complex features, safety-critical code |

## Choosing a Workflow

- **Use Branch Automation** when:
  - The feature is well-defined and straightforward
  - Human review is readily available
  - Your team has experience with AI-generated code

- **Use AI Safe Pipeline** when:
  - The feature is complex or touches critical systems
  - You need comprehensive automated validation
  - You want iterative improvement of AI-generated code
  - You need detailed reporting on code quality, security, etc.

## Integration between Workflows

The workflows can be used together in a complementary way:

1. Start with the **AI Safe Pipeline** for initial generation and validation
2. Once the pipeline completes successfully, use **Branch Automation** to promote the code through review and production stages

## Common Tools and Scripts

- **[branch-automation.sh](../../scripts/branch-automation.sh)**: Manages the standard three-stage workflow
- **[run-pipeline.sh](../../scripts/ai-pipeline/run-pipeline.sh)**: Runs the AI Safe Pipeline validation system

# AI Collaboration Workflows

This document outlines the workflows and best practices for collaborating with AI code assistants. It provides guidelines for effective AI-human collaboration in software development.

## Collaboration Models

### 1. Task-Specific AI Assistance

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant PR as Pull Request
    participant CI as CI/CD Pipeline
    
    Dev->>AI: 1. Define specific task
    AI->>Dev: 2. Generate implementation
    Dev->>Dev: 3. Review and refine
    Dev->>PR: 4. Submit implementation
    PR->>CI: 5. Run automated checks
    CI->>PR: 6. Return results
    PR->>Dev: 7. Address feedback
```

**Best For:**
- Well-defined, isolated features
- Utility functions and helpers
- Boilerplate code generation
- Test case generation

**Process:**
1. Developer defines a specific, bounded task
2. AI generates an implementation
3. Developer reviews, tests, and refines the implementation
4. Implementation is submitted for review
5. Automated checks verify quality and security
6. Implementation is merged after approval

### 2. Pair Programming with AI

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant Code as Codebase
    
    Dev->>AI: 1. Outline problem and approach
    AI->>Dev: 2. Suggest implementation strategy
    Dev->>Code: 3. Implement foundational code
    Dev->>AI: 4. Request specific implementations
    AI->>Dev: 5. Provide code snippets
    Dev->>Code: 6. Integrate and refine
    loop Iterative Development
        Dev->>AI: Ask questions or request improvements
        AI->>Dev: Provide suggestions or solutions
        Dev->>Code: Apply improvements
    end
```

**Best For:**
- Complex features requiring domain knowledge
- Architecture planning
- Refactoring existing code
- Performance optimization

**Process:**
1. Developer outlines the problem and approach
2. AI and developer collaborate on implementation strategy
3. Developer implements foundational code
4. AI assists with specific implementation details
5. Developer integrates AI suggestions and refines the solution
6. Iterative refinement through continued collaboration

### 3. AI-Driven Exploration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant Branch as Feature Branch
    participant Review as Code Review
    
    Dev->>AI: 1. Describe feature concept
    AI->>Dev: 2. Generate multiple approaches
    Dev->>AI: 3. Select preferred approach
    AI->>Branch: 4. Generate implementation in ai-gen branch
    Dev->>Branch: 5. Review and modify
    Branch->>Review: 6. Submit for team review
    Review->>Branch: 7. Provide feedback
    Branch->>Branch: 8. Address feedback
```

**Best For:**
- Exploring new libraries or frameworks
- Prototyping features
- Generating starter code for new components
- Evaluating different implementation approaches

**Process:**
1. Developer describes a feature concept
2. AI generates multiple implementation approaches
3. Developer selects preferred approach
4. AI generates implementation in a dedicated branch
5. Developer reviews, tests, and modifies the implementation
6. Team reviews the implementation
7. Feedback is addressed and implementation is refined

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Effective Task Description

A well-structured task description includes:

```
TASK: [Brief description of the task]

CONTEXT:
- [Project context and relevant information]
- [Current codebase structure or patterns]
- [Dependencies and constraints]

REQUIREMENTS:
- [Specific functionality requirements]
- [Performance requirements]
- [Security requirements]
- [Compatibility requirements]

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- [Criteria for successful implementation]
- [Test requirements]
- [Documentation requirements]

REFERENCES:
- [Links to relevant documentation]
- [Links to similar implementations]
- [Links to related code]
```

### 2. Iterative Refinement

For complex tasks, use iterative refinement:

1. **Outline Phase** - Describe high-level requirements
2. **Structure Phase** - Define component structure and interfaces
3. **Implementation Phase** - Implement specific components
4. **Refinement Phase** - Optimize and improve implementations
5. **Testing Phase** - Add tests and verify functionality

### 3. Feedback and Correction

When providing feedback to AI:

- Be specific about what needs to be changed
- Provide examples of correct implementations
- Explain the reasoning behind the changes
- Reference existing code patterns or documentation

## Branch and Review Workflow

### 1. Branch Naming Convention

```
ai-gen/[feature-name]             # Initial AI-generated code
ai-review/[feature-name]          # Code after human review
ai-prod/[feature-name]            # Production-ready code
```

### 2. Commit Message Format

```
[type]([scope]): [short description]

[detailed description]

[references]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(auth): implement password reset functionality

- Add password reset form component
- Create API endpoint for password reset requests
- Add email service integration for reset links
- Implement token validation logic

References: #123, #456
```
